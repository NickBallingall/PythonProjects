NOTE: I wrote this script to be distributed amongst the team I led in the 2024 Bloomberg Global Trading Challenge (BGTC), hence the instructional tone of the comments.

This script runs a Fama-French Five Factor Model on a security or portfolio, and then checks it for short-term-price reversals. Using this straightforward method of factor investing was decided upon to manage the BGTC workload alongside coursework for a team of people unfamiliar with investment analysis.

The short-term price reversal component was added in to account for the challenge's 6-week timespan and reduce the number of ultra-volatile stock pitches.
