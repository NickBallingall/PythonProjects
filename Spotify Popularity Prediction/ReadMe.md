Taken from an MSc Financial Technology coursework piece, this code uses regression models to predict song popularity based on different variables. Dataset is from Spotify.

There is some omitted EDA due to the coursework constraints. Plans to expand include using the Spotify API to better clean the data, and keep the core dataset more in-tact.
