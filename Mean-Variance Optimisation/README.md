This is an iterative Mean-Variance Optimisation script that takes a selection of equities (ETF holdings currently used) and provides the optimal selections & weightings based on the user's desired portfolio size.

T-bills are used for setting the risk-free rate, and the appropriate number can be selected based on intended investment time-frame.

This code was largely created as part of a university project. It does not run efficiently at all, and I hope to return and optimise it in my own time.
