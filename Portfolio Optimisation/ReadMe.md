Project taken from MSc FinTech coursework, with the requirement of using the Markowitz model for optimisation. Chose to include some factor models to filter for tech stocks with the "most explainable" returns. Just for curiosity's sake, I created a 'sentiment' factor using data from the VIX.

It was my first time using the RiskFolio library. Great tool, will be exploring more in the future.

Note: The tangency portfolio and efficient frontier are incorrect. It's entirely user error, as I got mixed up doing two things at once, and tried plotting multiple generated portfolios instead of the individual assets.
