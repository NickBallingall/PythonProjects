DISCLAIMER: This code doesn't work particularly well. It was my first attempt at generating 'random' data and I bit off more than I could chew for the deadline I was on with the related university (non-programming) project.

The goal was to generate user transaction data for our 'alternative academic research funding platform' social enterprise idea. The business' revenue would come from taking a percentage cut off user transactions, which were then subject to their own costs.

I tried creating 'random' transactions and user types (e.g. recurring, foreign, 'whales', etc.) and various growth rates to project how the business could go in its first few years, a and ultimately find a break-even point.

However, when generating the random data, I have made a mistake somewhere (and also produces a very awkward dataframe of lists to store the data) that caused cascading issues.

I won't be likely to ever finish this project, but I do plan on trying to generate complex user transactions again in a different project.
